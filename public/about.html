<h1>About Me</h1>
 <h2>Hello everybody!</h2>
<p>
 My name is Aja (31 years old) and I live in the capital of the Czech Republic - beautiful and historical Prague. I graduated at Charles University where I was studying political science.
</p>

<p>
  I am still quite new in the world of programming but I am really enjoying it! Because I did not really enjoy my previous job, I decided to have a think what else I could do and I got to know the power of data analytics.
  I have started to learn SQL which immediately caught my attention. Then I continued to learn a bit about data visualizations using Power BI and Tableau. Purely trying my luck, I applied for a position of a Data Analyst fairly shortly after taking these courses. To my big suprise, I was offered a job and I have been a Data Analyst for over a year now!! 
</p>

<p>After one year of coding mainly in SQL, I decided, it is time to deepen my knowledge about programming and I am taking this Udemy course for Web developers which I really enjoy. So far I have done some simple projects, but I am really happy about it as a few days ago I would not even believe, that I am capable of this.</p>
<p>I am very keen to keep up this progress and I cannot wait for more advanced projects coming in!</p>
